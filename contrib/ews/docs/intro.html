	<h1>Introduction to EWS</h1>
	<h2>What is the EWS?</h2>
	<p>The project implements the support to add the web service support 
	for a J2EE container. It provides a tool that generated the required code 
	based on the “packaged J2EE web service” (explained in the third chapter) 
	and the necessary runtime classes. EWS implementation is based on the JSR 109 
	“J2EE web services” specification by the JCP. It is also covered under the 
	web service’s support for J2EE 1.4 specification.  But it is not limited to 
	the specification and in the security and the transaction the specification is 
	exceeded.</p> 
	<h2>How EWS does fits into the J2EE and Web service stacks?</h2>
	<p>EWS act as the part of the deploy tool for J2EE container to deploy the 
	Web service in the J2EE container. EWS project provide a tool to accept the 
	J2EE module as explained by the JSR109 specification and generated the required 
	classes and the Runtime need to support the generated classes.</p>

	<h2>What are the Goals of the EWS?</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Integrated the parts of the Web service implementations and bind them as
		 a platform parallel to J2EE and fill any gaps. (E.g. Jaxrpc-mapping, 
		 specifying the Handler in the web service’s).</li> 
		<li>Give the web services a programming model that is equivalent to the 
		J2EE programming model. (Deploying a web service by writing an Interface 
		+ Implementation Bean and Deployment descriptors package it and deploy it 
		in the Container. Then the Container should implement the supporting classes 
		and make the web service available. .</li>  
		<li>Let the Web service to be implemented based on the J2EE components and by 
		doing so let it benefits from the value added services provide by the J2EE 
		container.</li>  
		<li>Define the security and transaction mapping from the web service to EJB 
		and the EJB to web services. And make it possible to propagate transaction or 
		the security information transparently through web service and EJBs.</li>  
		<li>Make it possible for the application deployer to provide the transaction 
		and security service to web service which are managed by the container and 
		added by adding a new entry to deployment descriptor.</li>  
	</ol>
	
	<h2>How Ways to write a J2EE web services?</h2>
	<h3>There are two Ways to implements a J2EE web services</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>J2EE web service based on Java Class.</li>
		<li>J2EE web service based on the Enterprise Java Bean</li>
	</ol>	

    <h3>Aapplication developer should create following files.</h3> 
    <ol>
		<li><a href="src/list4.txt">Service endpoint interface</a></li>
		<li><a href="src/list5.txt">Implementation bean</a></li> 
		<li>if web Service is based on EJB <a href="src/ejb-jar.xml">ejb-jar.xml</a> or Web Service is based on Java Class <a href="src/web.xml">web.xml</a> file</li> 
		<li><a href="src/webservice.xml">Webservices.xml</a> file</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Assembler Should packaged them to a Web Service Module.</h3>
	<p>Assembler should package those files in to a WAR file if it is 
	the “scenario 1” and to an EAR file if it is “scenario 2”. Additionally 
	EWS support deployment with JAR file as well.</p> 
	<h3>Deployer should deploy the Web Service Module using the deploy tool.</h3>
	
	<h2>How the Deployment of the Web Service Module Works?</h2>   
	<p>When the above J2EE package is created the deployer will use the deploy tool called Ws4J2ee provided by the EWS project to deploy the web service in the J2EE container. According to the specification the deploy tool should do the following to deploy the web service in the J2EE container.</p> 
	
	<h3>Validate the deployment artifacts</h3>
	<p>The deployment tool starts the deployment process by examining the deployable 
	artifact and determining which modules are Web services enabled by looking for 
	a webservices.xml deployment descriptor file contained within the module. 
	Deployment of services occurs before resolution of service references. This is 
	done to allow deployment to update the WSDL port addresses before the service 
	references to them are processed.</p>
	<h3>Convert the Web services into standard J2EE artifacts</h3>
	<p>A Servlet is provided / generated to handle parsing the incoming SOAP request 
	and dispatch it to an java implementation class or the EJB of the of the 
	Web Service. The Java Implementation class if present can be act like 
	another dependency class used by the above servlet. If the implementation 
	is a stateless session bean the servlet obtains a reference to an instance 
	of an appropriate EJBObject and dispatches the request to the stateless 
	session EJB. How the request is dispatched to the Service Implementation Bean 
	is dependent on the deployment tool and deploys time binding information 
	supplied by the deployer. Deployment of each port-component is dependent 
	upon the service implementation and container used. If Webservices.xml file
	 has security of transaction information the servlet and other J2EE artifacts 
	 will have the required information to enable the Security and/or Transaction 
	 in both J2EE and Web Service Domains.</p>  
	<h3>Deploy and publish the WSDLs</h3>
	<p>The deployment tool must deploy and publish all the ports of all 
	WSDL documents described in the Web services deployment descriptor. 
	The deployment tool updates or generates the WSDL port address for each 
	deployed port-component. The updated WSDL documents are then published to 
	a location determined by the deployer. It could be as simple as publishing 
	to a file in the modules containing the deployed services, a URL location 
	representing the deployed services of the server, a UDDI registry.</p> 
	<h3>Resolving references to Web services</h3> 
	<p>For each service reference described in the Web services client deployment 
	descriptors, the deployment tool ensures that the client code can access the
	 Web service. The deployment tool examines the information provided in the 
	 client deployment descriptor (the Service interface class, the Service Endpoint
	  Interface class, and WSDL ports the client wants to access) as well as the 
	  JAX-RPC mapping information. In general the procedure includes providing 
	  an implementation of the JAX-RPC Service interface class declared in 
	  the deployment descriptor service reference, generating stubs for all the 
	  service-endpoint-interface declarations (if generated Stubs are supported 
	  and the deployer decides to use them), and binding the Service class 
	  implementation into a JNDI namespace.</p>
	<h3>Deployment of generated J2EE artifacts</h3>
	<p>Once the Web services enabled deployable artifact has been converted into a 
	J2EE deployable artifact, the deployment process continues using normal 
	deployment processes.</p>
