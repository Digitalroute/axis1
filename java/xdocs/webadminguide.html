<p><h3><a name="_Toc96698076"></a>Introduction </h3>
<p>Axis2 web administration module provide a way to configure axis2 dynamically
 but those dynamic configuration wont be persistence, i.e. if the servlet 
 container restart then all the dynamic configuration changes will be lost.  </p>
 
 <p><h4><a name="_Toc96698076"></a>Loging into Administartion </h4>
<p>From axis2 index page you can go to administration page by following 
Axis2 Administration link, then logging page will be appeared asking user 
name and password , the default username = admin and default password = axis2 .
 You can change those two values by changing following two parameters in 
 server.xml as you required.

</p>
<p>If the login succeed you will be see a page like below , where you can use 
that to
 view the running system and dynamically configure the system. </p>
 <p align="left"><strong><img src="images/adminmain.jpg"></strong></p>
 
 <p>The list service in axis2 index page and here are almost the same but only 
 additional feature provide with admin module list service is, if there is any
  module engaged globally, to the service or to the operation those details
	 will be displayed here. </p>
	 
	 <p>To view the available modules in the "repository/modules" you just have
	  to click the view modules then it will show you all the available modules 
		in the system and only those modules can be dynamically engaged. </p>
		
		<p align="left"><strong><img src="images/modules.jpg"></strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>From the globally engaged modules you can see the globally engaged 
		modules if there is any , if a modules has engaged globally then the 
		handlers belong to that module will be executed irrespective of the service. 
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>In axis2 there are two levels of phases, system predefined phases 
		(not allowed to change) and user defined phases. The main difference 
		between those two levels of phases is irrespective of the service all
		 the system pre defined phases will be executed, if the dispatcher find
		  the corresponding operation then user defined phase list will be executed. 
			 And for the module developers and service writers are really required to 
			 have understanding about phases and their orders.   </p>
		<p align="left"><strong><img src="images/viewphases.jpg"></strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>	
		<p>The most interesting of axis2 web admin module is it provide a very basic 
		way of viewing the global phase list and handler inside the phases considering 
		both phase and handler orders. This kind of information is very valuable to 
		debug the system, because there is no way to list out the handlers in the 
		global chains except this. And if you engage a new module the new handlers 
		will be added to the global chains and those will be displayed in this view 
		phase page. </p> 
		
		<p align="left"><strong><img src="images/globalchain.jpg"></strong></p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>	
		<p>From the View Service phase and Handlers can view the handlers corresponding
		to a given service in the same order as there in the real execution chain. </p>

<p>Modules can be engage either globally, to a service or to an operation 
depending on the module implementation. If the module has implemented to 
engage globally then handlers in the module can be refers to any phase in 
the system, that is it can be either system predefined or user defined phase.</P>  
<p>In there other hand if the module has implemented in such a way that is going
 to be deployed to a service or to an operation then the module can NOT refers
  to any of system predefined phases. So that it can only refers to user defined phases. </p>
<p>Immediately after engaging the module you can see the status of the engagement 
, whether it is engaged properly or not.  </p>
