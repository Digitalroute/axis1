<h1 align="center">WebServices - Axis 2.0</h1>
<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>
<p>Axis 2.0 will be a platform for the next generation of web services / service 
oriented applications. To achieve this goal, we need to incorporate the latest 
in concepts in Web Services Architecture group and WSDL working group among 
others. For example, the architecture should be completely asynchronous and 
should support all kinds of MEP's. The platform must be very extensible 
(runtime, java2wsdl, wsdl2java etc) to accomodate the growing demand for 
different WS-* implementations. A &quot;module&quot; can very easily change the behaviour 
of existing components. For example, additional decorations can be added at 
runtime to the base wsdl (for example, for WSDM manageability spec). Presence of 
an addressing module could change the client code generated (where additional 
methods can be exposed) that make it easy to use addressing. One main focus is 
to improve the performance even in the presence of a heavy duty &quot;security&quot; 
module. </p>
<p>As a starting point we have started working on the core of Axis 2.0. This M1 
release will not have support for ANY JSR specs like JAX-RPC or SAAJ. But we 
will make sure we can build JAXRPC/SAAJ layers on top of the core architecture. 
The core is basically a streaming XML infoset that we call &quot;OM&quot; that supports 
deffered building and the xml pull event generation and async support will be 
baked in to the core as well. </p>
