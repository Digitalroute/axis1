	<h1>General</h1>
	<ol>
	<LI><strong>I see OMElements in all the signatures, in the stubs, Client API and in skeltons. Where is data binding?</strong><br>
	<p>Axis2 supports databinding using XML-Beans from 0.9 release. For more information please read the <a href="userguide.html">user guide</a></p> 
	</p>

	<LI><a name="a2"><strong>What is OMElement, What does it represents?</strong></a><br>
	<p>OMElement is Axis2 representation of XML, it provide a tree model like DOM. If you are familer with DOM or JDOM you can soon get familerize with OM quickly. For more information read<a href="OMTutorial.html"> Axiom Tutorial</a> </p>

	</ol>
	
	<h1>Client API</h1>
	<ol>
	
	<LI><strong>I want to do request response Messaging, Where should I look?</strong><br>
	<p>Look at the <a href="../modules/core/src/org/apache/axis2/clientapi/Call.java">Call</a> class, for more information please read the <a href="userguide.html">user guide</a> </p>
	</p>
	</LI>

	<LI><strong>I want to do One Way Messaging, Where should I look?</strong><br>
	<p>Look at the <a href="../modules/core/src/org/apache/axis2/clientapi/MessageSender.java">MessageSender</a> class, for more information please read the <a href="userguide.html">user guide</a> </p>
	</p>
	</LI>
	<LI><strong>Why can not I set the Addressing properties in the Call?</strong><br>
	<p>Only in the case of the Message Sender the user allowed to edit the Message Properties, In the case of Call the Message correlation is taken care by the Client API and the Addressing Headers are under the Control of Axis2.</p> 
	</p>
	</LI>
	
	<LI><strong>When I try to do a non blocking call with use Seperate Listener true I get the error <i>to do two Transport Channels the Addressing Modules must be engeged</i>, Why is this?</strong><br>
	<p>To do the two transport Channel invocation you need to engage the addressing module. You can enable it by uncommenting the entry in the axis2.xml file or Call.engageModule(QName).</p> 
	</p>
	</LI>
	
	<LI><a name="b5"><strong>What is the Axis Repository?</strong></a><br>
	<p>Repository store the configuration of Axis2, the users should specify the repository folder starting the Aixs Server (HTTP ot TCP). In the case of tomcat it is the webapps/axis2/WEB-INF folder. Following picture shows a sample repository.</p> 
	<img src="images/faq/1.jpg"/>
	<p>Modules and services have a archive format defined and they are automatically picked up by Axis2 when they are copied to corresponding folders. </p>
