<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc96698076"></a>Introduction </h2>
<p>Welcome to Axis 2.0, the next generation of Apache Axis !!! This User Guide will help you to understand what you will get from Axis 2.0 and how to get started. We hope you will benefit from the power of Axis 2.0. </p>
<h2><a name="_Toc96698077"></a>What is Axis 2.0 ? </h2>
<p>Before we start, its highly recommended to read <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/java/user-guide.html">Axis 1.x User's guide </a>, if you are new to Axis. </p>
<p>Axis 2.0 is the next generation of Apache Axis. In late August 2004, during the Axis Summit held in Colombo, Sri Lanka, a new architecture was introduced to have a much more flexible, efficient and configurable Axis. Even though the architecture is new, some of the well established concepts from Axis 1.x, like handlers are preserved in Axis 2.0 also. Axis 2.0 comes with lots of new features, enhancements and new industry specification implementations. </p>
<p>After months of continued discussion and coding effort in this direction, Axis 2.0 now delivers the following key features: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Speed</strong>. Axis uses its own object model and StAX (streaming) parsing to achieve significantly greater speed than earlier versions of Apache AXIS. </li>
  <li><strong>Low memory foot print</strong>. Axis 2.0 was designed ground-up keeping low memory foot print in mind. </li>
  <li><strong>AXIOM</strong>. Axis 2.0 comes with its own light-weight object model, AXIOM, for message processing which is extensible, high performance and developer convenient </li>
  <li><strong>Hot Deployment.</strong> One can now hot deploy web services and handlers. </li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous Web Services</strong>. Axis 2.0 now support asynchronous web services invocation and asynchronous web services. </li>
  <li><strong>MEP Support. </strong>Axis 2.0 now comes handy with support for Message Exchange Patterns. </li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>. The Axis architecture gives the developer complete freedom to insert extensions into the engine for custom header processing, system management, or anything else you can imagine. </li>
  <li><strong>Stability</strong>. Axis defines a set of published interfaces which change relatively slowly compared to the rest of Axis. </li>
  <li><strong>Component-oriented deployment</strong>. You can easily define reusable networks of Handlers to implement common patterns of processing for your applications, or to distribute to partners. </li>
  <li><strong>Transport framework</strong>. We have a clean and simple abstraction for designing transports (i.e., senders and listeners for SOAP over various protocols such as SMTP, FTP, message-oriented middleware, etc), and the core of the engine is completely transport-independent. </li>
  <li><strong>WSDL support.</strong> Axis 2.0 supports the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">Web Service Description Language </a>, version 1.1 and 2.0, which allows you to easily build stubs to access remote services, and also to automatically export machine-readable descriptions of your deployed services from Axis. </li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you enjoy using Axis. Please note that this is an open-source effort - if you feel the code could use some new features or fixes, please get involved and lend a hand! The Axis developer community welcomes your participation . </p>
<p>Let us know what you think! </p>
<p>Please send feedback about the package to &quot; <a href="mailto:axis-user@ws.apache.org">axis-user@ws.apache.org </a>&quot; and make sure to prefix the subject of the mail with “[Axis2]”. </p>

<!--<h3><a name="_Toc96698087"></a>Running the Axis2 standalone server </h3>
<p>Since a J2EE servlet container can be heavy in certain cases, a simple socket server is provided with Axis2. </p>
Start scripts are inluded in the bin directory of the binary distribution.</p>
<p>For windows</p>
			 <p class="command">&gt;start.bat </p>
<p>For Linux</p>
			 <p class="command">$start.sh</p>			 			 
<p>This will start the simple axis server in the default port (8080). To start the server in a non default port
the server script can be used. The sever script however needs two parameters, the repository location and the port.</p>

<p>For windows</p>
			 <p class="command">&gt;server <i>repository directory</i> <i>port</i> </p>
<p>For Linux</p>
			 <p class="command">$server <i>repository directory</i> <i>port</i> </p>			 			 
 
 <p><b>
 Note - the directory entered as the repository loacation needs to have a services directory inside. This is
 absolutely required and AXIS will not create it automatically in the case of the simple axis server. 
 </b></p> -->
<h2><a name="_Toc96697863"></a>Samples</h2>
<p>In this section of the user guide we will look at how to write and deploy Web Services and how to write Web Service Clients using Axis2. All the 
user guide samples are located at the <b> <span class="style9">
<font color="#000000">&quot;samples/userguide/src&quot;</font></span></b> directory 
of the binary distribution. So.. let's  explore the samples.</p>
<p>Note: Please note that the rest of this user guide assumes that the user has downloaded the binary distribution of Axis2. If you have already downloaded the source tree of Axis2 then please create the binary distribution by simply using the maven command <strong>maven dist-bin </strong>This will create the &quot;axis2-M2-bin.zip&quot; and &quot;axis2-M2-bin.tar&quot;  in the &quot;target/dist&quot; directory. Extract the zip or the tar ball to any 
directory in your machine and for the explanations purposes we will name this as &quot;Axis2Home&quot;. </p>
<h2> Web Services Using Axis2</h2>
<p>Before starting, please check wither you have deployed the &quot;axis2.war&quot; in your servlet container and it is working properly.(See;
<font color="#00FFFF">installation guide</font>)</p>
<h3>MyService</h3>
<p>First let's see how we can write a simple Web Service (MyService) and deploy it. For this purpose we will create a Web Service with two operations as follows.</p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3">public void ping(OMElement element){} //IN-ONLY operation, just accepts the OMElement and do some processing.
public OMElement echo(OMElement element){}//IN-OUT operation, accepts an OMElement and responds with another OMElement after processing.</pre>
<p>Complete code for this example Web Service (MyService) can be found in the &quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide/src&quot; directory under 
&quot;userguide/example1&quot; package. As you can see, the two operations are very simple and need no explanations on what they are doing. So let's see how we can write the deployment descriptors for the service and deploy it.</p>
<p>Axis2 uses &quot;service.xml&quot; to keep configurations for a Web Service. Each Web Service deployed 
in Axis2 needs a &quot;service.xml&quot; containing the configurations. &quot;service.xml&quot; for MyService will be as follows; we will see what each parameter means later.</p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3">&lt;service name=&quot;MyService&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;description&gt;<br>        This is a sample Web Service with two operations,echo and ping.<br>    &lt;/description&gt;<br>    &lt;parameter name=&quot;ServiceClass&quot; locked=&quot;xsd:false&quot;&gt;userguide.example1.MyService&lt;/parameter&gt;<br>    &lt;operation name=&quot;echo&quot;&gt;<br>        &lt;messageReceiver class=&quot;org.apache.axis.receivers.RawXMLINOutMessageRecevier&quot;/&gt;<br>    &lt;/operation&gt;<br>     &lt;operation name=&quot;ping&quot;&gt;<br>        &lt;messageReceiver class=&quot;org.apache.axis.receivers.RawXMLINOnlyMessageRecevier&quot;/&gt;<br>    &lt;/operation&gt;<br> &lt;/service&gt;</pre>
<p>As it can be seen, first line of the &quot;service.xml&quot; gives the name of the Web Service. This is used in the URL to the service as the service name. Next comes the description and the service class. The next two xml tags describe the operations that are available in this service with respective message receivers. For the &quot;echo&quot; operation we have used a <strong>RawXMLINOutMessageRecevier</strong> since it is an 
IN-OUT operation. For IN-ONLY operation, &quot;ping&quot; we have used <strong>RawXMLINOnlyMessageRecevier</strong> as the message receiver. </p>
<p>Axis2 use &quot;.aar&quot; (Axis Archive) file as the deployment package for Web Services. So, 
for MyService we will use &quot;MyService.aar&quot; with the &quot;service.xml&quot; packaged 
in the META-INF as shown in the following picture.</p>
<p><img src="images/userguide/ServiceItems.JPG" width="176" height="91"></p>
<p>To create  &quot;MyService.aar&quot;  user can first create a jar file containing all the files necessary for the service and then rename the &quot;jar&quot; to &quot;aar&quot; so that Axis2 understands it as a service archive. 
This has already been created in the &quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide&quot; directory, 
and let's use it.. </p>
<p>Since this is our first Web Service&nbsp; we need one more step before we 
deploy the service. That is to create a directory named &quot;<b>services</b>&quot; under &quot;webapps/axis2/WEB-INF&quot; of you servlet container. Deploying is just a matter of 
dropping the &quot;.aar&quot; in to this directory and hence please copy the &quot;MyService.aar&quot; into the 
&quot;<b>services</b>&quot; directory. Once these steps are completed, please start the servlet container (if you have not already started) and check the link &quot;List Available services&quot; in the page http://localhost:8080/axis2/index.jsp and see whether the MyService is deployed properly. If 
everything is ok, you will see the following out put.. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="images/userguide/MyServiceDeployed.JPG" width="797" height="654"> </p>
<p>If you can see the above out put then you have successfully deployed MyService on Axis2. Now let's see how we can write Web Service client to use this services. 
Axis2 provides an easy way to deploy a Web Services using, index.jsp. (See the 
installation guide for more information on this)</p>
<h2> Web Service Clients Using Axis2 </h2>
<h3>EchoBlockingClient</h3>
<p>Axis2 provides the user with several invocation patterns for Web Services, ranging from pure blocking single channel invocations to a non-blocking dual channel invocations. First let's see how we can write a client to invoke &quot;echo&quot; operation of &quot;MyService&quot; using the simplest good old blocking invocation. The client code that you need to write will be as follows.</p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3">  try {
            OMElement payload = ClientUtil.getEchoOMElement();
            <span class="style10">Call call = new Call();
            call.setTo(targetEPR);
            call.setTransportInfo(Constants.TRANSPORT_HTTP, Constants.TRANSPORT_HTTP, false);

            OMElement result = (OMElement) call.invokeBlocking("echo", payload);
</span>
            StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
            result.serializeWithCache(XMLOutputFactory.newInstance().createXMLStreamWriter(writer));
            writer.flush();

            System.out.println(writer.toString());

        } catch (AxisFault axisFault) {
            axisFault.printStackTrace();
        } catch (XMLStreamException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
}
</pre></p>
<p>The green lines shows the set of operations that you need to perform in-order to invoke a web service while the rest is used to create the OMElement that needs to be sent and to display the response OMElement. To test this 
client you can use the &quot;TestEchoBlockingClient.bat&quot; that can be found in the &quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide/src/userguide/clients/bin&quot; directory. The 
.bat or .sh files show the required jars that needs to be there in the classpath for one to write Web Service clients using Axis2. So if you can see the response OMElement printed in your command line (as shown below)  then you have successfully tested the client as well. </p>
<p><img src="images/userguide/TestClient.JPG" width="951" height="132"></p>
<h3>PingClient</h3>
<p>In the Web Service &quot;MyService&quot; we had a IN-ONLY operation with the name &quot;ping&quot; (see Web Services Using Axis2). So let's write a client to invoke this operation as well. 
The client code will be as follows.</p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3"> try {
       OMElement payload = ClientUtil.getPingOMElement();

       MessageSender msgSender = new MessageSender();
       msgSender.setTo(targetEPR);
       msgSender.setSenderTransport(Constants.TRANSPORT_HTTP);
       msgSender.send("ping", payload);

     } catch (AxisFault axisFault) {
            axisFault.printStackTrace();
     }
</pre>
</p> 
<p>Since we are accessing a IN-ONLY operation we can directly use the &quot;MessageSender&quot; to invoke this operation. As it can be seen in the above code , it is very straight forward to invoke this type of operation. MessageSender will not block the 
invocation, hence it will return the control immediately back to the client. You can 
test this client using the &quot;TestPingClient.bat&quot; that is in &quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide/src/userguide/clients/bin&quot;.</p>
<p>Ok, we have invoked the two operations in our service, Are we done? No!, there are lot more to explore, Let's see some other ways to invoke 
the same operations.</p>
<h3>EchoNonBlockingClient</h3>
<p>In the EchoBlockingClient once the &quot;call.invokeBlocking("echo", payload);&quot; is called, the client is blocked till the operation is completed. This behavior is not 
desirable when there are many Web Service invocations to be done in a single client application. A solution, would be to use a Non-Blocking API to invoke web services. Axis2 provides a callback based non-blocking API for users. </p>
<p>A sample client for this can be found under &quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide/src/userguide/clients&quot; with the name EchoNonBlockingClient. If we consider the changes that the user may have to do with respect to the &quot;EchoBlockingClient&quot; that we have already seen, it will be as follows.</p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3">call.invokeNonBlocking(&quot;echo&quot;, payload, callback);</pre>
<p>The invocation  accepts a callback object as a parameter. Axis2 client API provides an 
abstract Callback with the following methods.</p>
<p><pre class="style1 style2 style3">public abstract void onComplete(AsyncResult result);
public abstract void reportError(Exception e);
public boolean isComplete() {}</pre></p>
<p>The user is expected to implement the &quot;onComplete &quot; and &quot;reportError &quot; methods of their extended call back class. Axis2 engine calls the onComplete method once the Web Service 
response is received by the Axis2 Client API (Call). This will eliminate the blocking nature of the Web Service invocations and provides the user with the flexibility to use Non Blocking API for Web Service 
Clients.</p>
<p>To run the sample client ( EchoNonBlockingClient) you can simply use the &quot;TestEchoNonBlockingClient.bat&quot; or &quot;TestEchoNonBlockingClient.sh&quot; files that can be found in the &quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide/src/userguide/clients/bin&quot; directory. </p>
<h3>EchoNonBlockingDualClient </h3>
<p>The solution provided by the Non-Blocking API has one limitation when it 
comes to&nbsp; Web Service invocations which takes long time to complete. The limitation 
is due to the use of single transport connection to invoke the Web Service and to retrieve the response. In 
other words, client API provides a non blocking invocation mechanism for the users, but the request and the response comes in a single  transport connection (needs two way transports like HTTP). Long 
running Web Service invocations or Web Service invocations using One-Way transports (like SMTP) cannot be utilized by simply using a non blocking invocation. </p>
<p>The trivial solution is to use separate transport connections (either One-Way or Two-Way) for the request and response. The next problem that needs to be 
solved is the correlation (correlating the request and the response). 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Submission/ws-addressing/">WS-Addressing</a> provides a neat solution to above using &lt;wsa:MessageID&gt; and &lt;wsa:RelatesTo&gt; headers. Axis2 provides support for  addressing&nbsp; based correlation mechanism and a complying Client API to invoke Web Services with two transport connections. 
(core of Axis2 does not depend on WS-Addressing, and it is the addressing like 
properties, hence Axis2 has the flexibility to use different versions of 
addressing)</p>
<p>Users can select between Blocking or Non-Blocking APIs for the Web Service clients 
with two transport connections. By simply using a boolean flag, the same API can be used to invoke web 
services (IN-OUT operations) using two separate transport connections. Let's see how we can do it using an example. Following code 
fragment shows how to invoke the same &quot;echo&quot; operation, using Non-Blocking API with two transport 
connections<strong>. The ultimate asynchrony!!</strong></p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3">  try {
            OMElement payload = ClientUtil.getEchoOMElement();

            Call call = new Call();
            call.setTo(targetEPR);

            //The boolean flag informs the axis2 engine to use two separate transport connection
            //to retrieve the response.
            <font color="#33CC00">call.engageModule(new QName(Constants.MODULE_ADDRESSING));</font>
            call.setTransportInfo(Constants.TRANSPORT_HTTP, Constants.TRANSPORT_HTTP, <span class="style13">true</span>);

            //Callback to handle the response
            Callback callback = new Callback() {
                public void onComplete(AsyncResult result) {
                    try {
                        StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
                        result.getResponseEnvelope().serializeWithCache(
                                XMLOutputFactory.newInstance().createXMLStreamWriter(writer));
                        writer.flush();

                        System.out.println(writer.toString());

                    } catch (XMLStreamException e) {
                        reportError(e);
                    }
                }

                public void reportError(Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            };

            //Non-Blocking Invocation
            call.invokeNonBlocking("echo", payload, callback);

            //Wait till the callback receives the response.
            while (!callback.isComplete()) {
                Thread.sleep(1000);
            }</pre>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3">	  <font color="#33CC00">call.close();</font>

        } catch (AxisFault axisFault) {
            axisFault.printStackTrace();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
</pre>
<p>The three changes that we need do to the EchoNonBlockingClient are shown in the &quot;green&quot; color. Since our correlation mechanism is based on addressing we need 
to first &quot;<strong>engage</strong>&quot; the addressing module.<span class="style15">
<font color="#000000"><b>&quot;call.engageModule(new 
QName(Constants.MODULE_ADDRESSING));&quot; </b>informs the Axis2 engine to engage the 
addressing module at the client side. The boolean flag (value true) in the &quot;<br>
<b>call.setTransportInfo(...)</b>&quot; method informs the Axis2 engine to use 
separate transport connections for request and response. Finally &quot;<b>call.close()</b>&quot; 
informs the Axis2 engine to stop the client side listener started to retrieve 
the response.</font></span></p>
<p>Before we run the sample client we need one more step to perform. As mentioned earlier Axis2 uses addressing based correlation 
mechanism and hence we need to &quot;engage&quot; addressing module in the server side as well. According to the Axis2 architecture addressing module is deployed in the &quot;<strong>pre-dispatch</strong>&quot; 
phase (See <a href="Axis2ArchitectureGuide.html">Architecture Guide</a> for more 
details about phases)&nbsp; and hence &quot;engaging&quot; means simply adding module reference in the &quot;server.xml&quot; (NOT the &quot;service.xml&quot;). Please add the following line to the &quot;server.xml&quot; that you can find in the &quot;/webapps/axis2/WEB-INF&quot; 
directory in the servlet container. </p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3"> &lt;module ref=&quot;addressing&quot;/&gt;</pre>
<p>Note: Please note that<span class="style15"><font color="#000000"> once you change the &quot;server.xml&quot; you need to restart the servlet container.</font></span></p>
<p>This will enable the addressing in the server side and now you can test the &quot;TestEchoNonBlockingDualClient&quot; using the &quot;TestEchoNonBlockingDualClient.bat&quot; or &quot;TestEchoNonBlockingDualClient.sh&quot; provided under &quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide/src/userguide/clients/bin&quot; directory. 
If you can see the response OMElement printed in the client side, that means you 
have successfully tested the Non Blocking API with two transport channels at the 
client side.</p>
<h3>EchoBlockingDualClient </h3>
<p>This is again a two transport request/response client, but this time, we use 
a Blocking API in the client code. Sample code for this can be found in the 
&quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide/src/userguide/clients/&quot; directory and the 
explanation is similar to the EchoNonBlockingDualClient, except that here we do 
not use a callback object to handle response. This is a very useful mechanism 
when the service invocation is IN-OUT in nature and the transports are One-Way 
(e.g. SMTP). For the sample client we use two HTTP connections for request and 
response. User can test this client using the &quot;EchoBlockingDualClient.bat&quot; or &quot;EchoBlockingDualClient.sh&quot; 
found in the &quot;Axis2Home/samples/userguide/src/userguide/clients/bin&quot; directory.</p>
<h2>Modules</h2>
<p>Axis2 provides an extended support for modules (See
<a href="Axis2ArchitectureGuide.html">Architecture Guide</a> for more details 
about modules in axis2). Let's see how we can create a custom module and deploy 
it to the MyService that we have created earlier. Creating and deploying a 
custom moduel for a service in Axis2 can be described using the following steps.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create the Module Implementation</li>
  <li>Create the Handlers</li>
  <li>Create the moduel.xml</li>
  <li>Package in a &quot;.mar&quot; (Module Archive)</li>
  <li>Deploy in Axis2</li>
</ol>
<h3>MyService with a Logging Module 
</h3>
<p>First let's write the LoggingModule (We will write a simple logging module 
that will simply log the messages). The module&nbsp; has a similar file 
hierarchy as shown below.</p>
<p>
<img border="0" src="images/userguide/ModuleView.JPG" width="185" height="120"></p>
<h4>
Step1</h4>
<p>LoggingModule is the implementation class of the Axis2 module. Axis2 modules 
should implement the &quot;org.apache.axis.modules.Module&quot; interface with the 
following methods.</p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3">public void init(AxisConfiguration axisSystem) throws AxisFault;//Initialize the module
public void shutdown(AxisConfiguration axisSystem) throws AxisFault;//End of module processing
</pre>
<p>These methods can be used to control the module initialization and the 
termination. With the input parameter AxisConfiguration, the user is provided 
with the complete configuration hierarchy and this can be used to fine tune the 
module behavior by the module writers. For the simple logging service that we 
are going to write we can keep these methods blank in our implementation class.</p>
<h4>Step2</h4>
<p>A module in axis2 can contain, one or more handlers that performs various 
SOAP header processing at different phases. (See<a href="Axis2ArchitectureGuide.html"> 
Architecture Guide</a> for more information about phases). For the logging 
module we will write a handle with the following methods.</p>
<pre class="style1 style2 style3">public class LogHandler extends AbstractHandler implements Handler {
    private Log log = LogFactory.getLog(getClass());
    private QName name;

    public QName getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void invoke(MessageContext msgContext) throws AxisFault {
        log.info(msgContext.getEnvelope().toString());
    }

    public void revoke(MessageContext msgContext) {
        log.info(msgContext.getEnvelope().toString());
    }

    public void setName(QName name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
</pre>
<h4>Step3</h4>
<p>&quot;module.xml&quot; contains the deployment configurations for a particular module. 
It contains details such as Implementation class of the module (in this example 
it is the &quot;LoggingModuel&quot; class and the various handlers that will run in 
different phases. &quot;module.xml&quot; for the logging module will be as follows.</p>
<p>
<pre  class="style1 style2 style3">&lt;module name=&quot;logging&quot; class=&quot;userguide.loggingmodule.LoggingModule &quot;&gt;
&lt;inflow&gt;
&lt;handler name=&quot;InFlowLogHandler&quot; class=&quot;userguide.loggingmodule.LogHandler&quot;&gt;
&lt;order phase=&quot;loggingPhase&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/handler&gt;
&lt;/inflow&gt;

&lt;outflow&gt;
&lt;handler name=&quot;OutFlowLogHandler&quot; class=&quot;userguide.loggingmodule.LogHandler&quot;&gt;
&lt;order phase=&quot;loggingPhase&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/handler&gt;
&lt;/outflow&gt;

&lt;Outfaultflow&gt;
&lt;handler name=&quot;FaultOutFlowLogHandler&quot; class=&quot;userguide.loggingmodule.LogHandler&quot;&gt;
&lt;order phase=&quot;loggingPhase&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/handler&gt;
&lt;/Outfaultflow&gt;

&lt;INfaultflow&gt;
&lt;handler name=&quot;FaultInFlowLogHandler&quot; class=&quot;userguide.loggingmodule.LogHandler&quot;&gt;
&lt;order phase=&quot;loggingPhase&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/handler&gt;
&lt;/INfaultflow&gt;
