<h1>Code Generator Wizard</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Axis2 code generator comes built-in with an
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> plug-in. This document explains the 
installation and usage of the Axis2 code generator plug-in.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>The easiest way to obtain the plug-in would be the binary distribution. The 
full Axis binary distribution contains the compiled version of this plug-in 
under the tools directory. </p>
<p>If one needs to build the plugin from source it is not as trivial as running 
the Maven build. The reason is that the plug-in depends heavily on the Eclipse 
classes, which are only available in an Eclipse environment. The recommended 
procedure is to run the create-project.xml build file which will create two 
folders (the other one for the Service Archiver tool) and copy the necessary 
files to relevant folders. Then Eclipse should be configured to open the 
contents in a PDE project. Please go through the Eclipse documentation to learn 
how to open projects in the PDE format.</p>
<p>Once you've obtained the plug-in just unzip the content of the plug-in 
archive to the eclipse plug-in directory (if it is the zipped-binary version) or 
copy the necessary folders to the eclipse plug-in directory and restart Eclipse.</p>
<p><i>Note - This plug-in works on Eclipse version 3.0 and upwards</i></p>
<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>If the plug-in is properly installed you should see a new wizard under the 
&quot;New&quot; section.(use the File -&gt; New -&gt; Other or Ctrl + N ) </p>

<p>Selecting the wizard and pressing the next button will start the code 
generator wizard. Following is the first wizard page.</p>

<p>To move on to the next page the WSDL file location must be given. The browse 
button can be used to easily browse for a file rather than typing the whole 
path.</p>
<p>Once the WSDL file is selected, codegen options are to be selected. By far 
this is the most important page in this wizard, which determines the 
characteristics of the code being generated. Novices need not worry about these 
options since the most common options are defaulted, But advanced users will 
find it very easy to &quot;turn the knobs&quot; using these options.</p>

<p>Once the options are taken care of, only the final step of the code 
generation is left. it is the selection of the output file location.</p>
