This is a performance summary of 2 implementations of Element interface in AXIOM. 
One implementation uses <code>java.util.ArrayList</code> to hold child elements while the other 
keeps pointers to the first child and next/previous sibling in each element-- thus 
burning in the linked list into Element class itself. The latter as you know is what 
is used in AXIOM at the moment. However, recently there have been some discussion 
as to whether that is the right way to go...
</p><p>
Each row in the table below shows one set of test results. Each test comprised of first 
creating an Element, then adding a number of child elements and finally traversing all
 the child elements added. The number of child elements added and the number 
 of traversals performed have been varied. Two approaches were used for traversing 
 the children when using an <code>ArrayList</code>. One used an <code>Iterator</code> while the other used 
 a 'for' loop. The details can be found by inspecting the code
 (<a href="ALElement.java">ALElement</a>, <a href="LLElement.java">LLElement</a>).
</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="Tester.java"><code>Tester</code></a> for info on how
the test was carried out.</p>
