To be honest, my goal for Axis 2 is world's first and best JAX-RPC 2.0 and SAAJ NG implementation for J2EE 5.0, which is expected to be released in late 2005. However, Axis 2 is not just a Java standard implementation. As you might notice, we really hope to make it as good as possible for web services platform. What I will try to do is helping Axis 2 for Java and Java for Axis 2.

Here's a short introduction of my scratch.

jax-rpc2 : JAX-RPC 2.0 early implementation based on its ED spec.

jaxb2: JAX-RPC 2.0 requires this, so I'll research it.

saaj-ng: SAAJ NG is first going to meet DOM level 3, then we need to talk about it with Sun's SAAJ 1.2 maintenance spec lead :-)

axis4tiger: the current Axis Java is not compilable on J2SE 5.0 mainly due to some package names including a new keyword "enum" and SAAJ 1.2's low DOM level. Axis for Tiger is also supposed to be improved based on J2SE 1.4. In summary, J2SE 1.4 is required and J2SE 5 is OK for building Axis for Tiger.

xml-bc: XML Binary Characterization.

Thanks,
