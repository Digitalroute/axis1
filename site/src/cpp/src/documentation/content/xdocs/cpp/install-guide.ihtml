<H2>Pre-requisites</H2>
You need to have the following in order to run Axis C++.<BR/>

<P>
<A href="http://archive.apache.org/dist/xml/xerces-c/Xerces-C_2_2_0/">Xerces
C++ (2.2.0)</A> XML parser<BR/>
<BR/>

Axis C++ needs an XML parser to parse SOAP messages and WSDD files. It
has a parser abstraction layer that helps users to select/switch between
parsers. However only one parser library can be used at a time.
Currently Xerces parser is supported by Axis C++.

<H3>Server only</H3>
<P><A name="server_prereqs"></A><A href="http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi">Apache web server </A> (2.0.x or 1.3.x)&nbsp; - If you are going to deploy services to Apache web server (and not

need to have Apache built with module .so support.<BR/>

<H2>Installing and Configuring Axis C++</H2>



<H3>Client Installation and Configuration</H3>
<H4>1. Download Axis C++</H4>
<P><A name="Installing_Client"></A><A href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/cpp/download.html">Download Axis
C++</A> binary distribution and extract the package into a directory of your choice.
</P>
<H4>2. Install Xerces C++ (2.2.0)</H4>
<p>See the Xerces parser's documentation for installation instructions. </p>
<H4><B>3. Configure environment variables</B></H4>
<B>set AXISCPP_DEPLOY<BR/>
<BR/></B>AXISCPP_DEPLOY="Path to the folder where you installed Axis C++
<BR/>
e.g. <I>AXISCPP_DEPLOY="/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy"<B><BR/>
<BR/>
set LIBRARY_PATHS </B></I>

<P>The library path needs to have the xml parser libraries and the axis libraries included.</P> Windows:<BR/>
PATH=&lt;xerces installation directory&gt;/bin;%AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin%;%PATH%<P>Linux:<BR/>LD_LIBRARY_PATH="&lt;xerces installation directory&gt;/lib:$AXISCPP_DEPLOY/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
</P>

<H4>4. Set Engine Wide Settings in Configuration File</H4>
<P>
The axiscpp.conf file contains all of the user defined setting for the location of specific libraries, definition and
log files and can be configured manually or by using the AxisConfiguration executable. <BR/>
If the user requires a non-standard environment or needs additional information to be
supplied (i.e. the location of the client wsdd file) this has to be defined in the axiscpp.conf file. <BR/>
</P>
<H5>4.1 Using AxisConfiguration to create the axiscpp.conf file</H5>
<P>
The AxisConfiguration executable is a simple user interface that allows the user to generate an axiscpp.conf file by
first asking a few simple questions about where the package was unzipped to and then allowing the user to pick which
file should be associated with configuration tag.  Below is an example of a typical conversation between
AxisConfiguration and a user (the normal, larger text represents user input).<BR/>
<BR/><PRE>
C:\Axis\axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin>AxisConfiguration Client<BR/>
Axis Client Configuration<BR/>
=========================<BR/>
Type in the Axis fully qualified directory path (e.g. C:\Axis)
used when Axis was unzipped (NB: this directory must also contain the
axiscpp.conf file).  Type '*' to used the existing value of the environment
variable (i.e. 'C:\Axis').<BR/>
AXISCPP_DEPLOY = <B>c:\Axis</B><BR/>
<BR/>
Type in the directory where the Axis libraries (e.g. axis_client.dll) can be
found.  (If you type '*', it will use the default 'axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin').<BR/>
Axis binaries directory = <B>axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin</B><BR/>
<BR/>
Begin to configure the AXISCPP.CONF file.<BR/>
<BR/>
Select the filename for the HTTP Transport library.<BR/>
1.      c:\Axis\axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin\HTTPTransport.dll<BR/>
Automatically selected c:\Axis\axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin\HTTPTransport.dll<BR/>
<BR/>
Select the filename for the HTTP Channel library.<BR/>
1.      C:\Axis\axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin\HTTPChannel.dll<BR/>
Automatically selected c:\Axis\axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin\HTTPChannel.dll<BR/>
<BR/>
Select the filename for the HTTP SSL Channel library.<BR/>
1.      C:\Axis\axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin\HTTPSSLChannel.dll<BR/>

<BR/>
Select the filename for the Axis XML Parser library.<BR/>
1.      C:\Axis\axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin\AxisXMLParserXerces.dll<BR/>
Automatically selected C:\Axis\axis-c-1.6-Win32-bin\bin\AxisXMLParserXerces.dll<BR/>
<BR/>
Select the filename for the SMTP Transport library.<BR/>
There are no recognised file names for the type of file/library.<BR/>
You will have to modify the configuration file namually.<BR/>
<BR/>
Enter name of client trace/log file: <B>client.log</B><BR/>
<BR/>
Select the filename for the client WSDD path.<BR/>
There are no recognised file names for the type of file/library.<BR/>
You will have to modify the configuration file namually.<BR/>

<H3>Server Installation and Configuration</H3>
<P><A name="Server_installation_and_configuration"></A></P>
<H4>1. Download Axis C++</H4>
<P><A href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/cpp/download.html">Download Axis
C++</A> binary distribution and extract the package into a directory of
your choice. <B><BR/>
</B></P>
<H4>2. Install Apache Web Server</H4>
<p> If you are going to deploy services to Apache and not use the simple_axis_server then you need to install apache webserver. In case you have already installed Apache
, make sure that 'so modules' are enabled. <BR/> This is because
Axis C++ server engine is implemented as a 'so module'. (For Apache
1.3.x use --enable-module=so; for Apache 2.0.x use --enable-so when
configuring. See Apache web server documentation for more details)</p>

<H4>3. Install Xerces C++ (2.2.0)</H4>
<p>See the Xerces parser's documentation for installation instructions. </p>
<H4>4. Configure environment variables</H4>
<p>
<b></b>The Axis server runtime requires the same variables to be set as the Axis client engine does.</p>

<H4>5. Configure Engine Wide Settings in Configuration File</H4>
<P><P><A name="Configure server axiscpp.conf"></A>As with the client-side the Axis C++ server-side engine uses a configuration file to let the user specify
preferences such as log file locations, transport and parser libs to be
used and location of deployment descriptor files. <BR/>
A sample configuration file is installed in
$AXISCPP_DEPLOY/etc folder (or in %AXISCPP_DEPLOY% on windows). Edit this file to match your systems
settings and copy or rename it to &quot;axiscpp.conf&quot;<BR/>

<BR/>

Configuration file has the following <B>Syntax:</B></P>
<P><BR/>

</P>
<P>The comment character is '#'<BR/>
WSDDFilePath - Path to the server wsdd file: Required - so that Axis knows what services and handlers you have deployed<BR/>Transport_http - Axis HTTP transport library: Required <BR/>
Channel_HTTP - Axis Channel transport library: Required  <BR/>
XMLParser - Axis XML parser library: Required<BR/>
LogPath: Path to the Axis C++ server log: Optional - only required if
you want to see trace from the Axis Engine for debugging purposes</P>

Transport_http:/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy/lib/libaxis3_transport.so
Channel_HTTP:/usr/local/axiscpp_deploy/lib/libaxis3_transport_channel.so
</PRE><H4>6. Setting Axis files to be executable</H4>
<P>On non-windows platforms you need to ensure  global access rights to the Axis C++ deploy folder to make sure that Axis C++ works properly.<BR/>
<BR/>

<I><B>chmod -R 777 $AXISCPP_DEPLOY</B></I> </P>

<H4>7. Configure Apache Module</H4>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> to execute the following steps, you may need to have <strong>administrator rights</strong> on your machine.
<BR/>
<BR/>

Now you need to  edit
<b>httpd.conf</b> file in &lt;path to Apache web server installation&gt;/conf
and add the following lines at the bottom of that file (assuming you
are using Apache 2.0.x):<BR/>

(Linux)<BR/>
<BR/>

<b>LoadModule axis_module modules/libaxiscpp_mod2.so</b><BR/>

<b>&lt;Location /axis&gt;</b><BR/>
<b>SetHandler axis </b> <BR/>
<b>&lt;/Location&gt;</b><BR/>
<BR/>
For Apache1.3.x LoadModule line should read as:<BR/>

<b>LoadModule axis_module libexec/libaxiscpp_mod.so</b> </p><pre>
</pre>

<H4>8. Deploying Axis Module to Apache Web Server </H4>

<p>Now we need to copy Apache module (libaxiscpp_mod2.so - linux names- for Apache 2.0.x and 
libaxiscpp_mod.so for Apache 1.3.x) to the correct places and start Apache web server.
The steps to follow are:
<ol>
<li> Copy libaxiscpp_mod2.so to /&lt;your Apache 2.0.x home&gt;/modules (or copy libaxiscpp_mod.so to /&lt;your Apache 1.3.x home&gt;/libexec)</li>
<li> Start Apache /&lt;path to Apache installation&gt;/bin/apachectl start </li>
</ol> 

<p>
To do the same you can you can use scripts in $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin.</p>

<b>cd $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin </b> <BR/> 
<p>                                       
To deploy with Apache 2.0.x </p>
<b>sh deploy_apache2.sh </b> <BR/>
<p>
To deploy with Apache 1.3.x </p>
<b>sh deploy_apache.sh </b>

<H4>9. See Axis C++ in action</H4>
<p>
Now the installation is complete. You can verify that the server side is working by accessing the URL <a  href="http://localhost/axis">http://localhost/axis</a> using your web browser. You should get the Axis C++ welcome page and this page will show you a list of deployed services as specified by the
&lt;Axis Installation directory&gt;/conf/server.wsdd file. Although at this stage you won't have any services deployed yet.</p><p>Now you can <A
	href="clientuser-guide.html">run a client sample</A> and see if it works.</p>

<strong></strong><p>
</p>
<H3> Simple Axis Server installation and configuration</H3>

<p><A name="Simple_Axis_Server_Installation_and_Configuration"></A>1. Make sure that you have set the  <b>AXISCPP_DEPLOY</b>  environment variable to point to your deployment folder as mentioned above </p>

<p>2. Create your axiscpp.conf file as above for the Apache server-side making sure that the contents of that  file match your system settings <p>3. Run simple axis server in  <b> $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin </b> <BR/>
Synopsis: simple_axis_server server-port Where server-port is the port on which you would like the server to listen for
client requests.</p>

<p> For Example (linux):</p>
<p><b>cd $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin </b> </p>
<p><b>./simple_axis_server 9090</b> </p>

<p>5. Run clients in <b> $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin </b> </p>
<p> On a different shell: </p>
<p><b>cd $AXISCPP_DEPLOY/bin </b> </p>
<p><b>./base http://localhost:9090/axis/base </b> </p>
<p>Similarly you could run the other samples. </p>
